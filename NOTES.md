# Scope
Things that are *not* in-scope:
- Fully-simulated Elite: Dangerous-style space flight (though this would be extremely cool)
- Super realistic star system generation (i *would* do this, but it is too hard!)

Things that *are* in-scope:
- Procedurally generated universe
- Fancy skybox that uses actually nearby star systems and planets
- Landable planets (Starbound-style: no seamless transition)
- Space stations/starships
