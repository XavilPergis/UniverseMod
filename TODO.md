# Short-ish term

## Rendering
- Figure out how to properly size celestial body billboards/cubes/spheres/whatever
	- FOV needs to be taken into account
- When using the spyglass, info about the targeted celestial body should be displayed

## Other
- Day/night cycle based on star system configuration
- Use integration for figuring out where planets are in their orbits instead of a function based on time (it breaks down for elliptical orbits)
- Server-authoratative celestial body positioning
- Spyglass with larger zoom
- Augment that shows the celestial bodies that belong to the current system

# Longterm
- Logistics ships!
- Space stations/custom space ships
- In-world starmap
- Figure out mod progression
- Planet compositions and scanning
	- Maybe you have to collect data on a planet before you can land
	- Preliminary scans could show material composition (eg. what % tin the planet is made of)
	- Intensive scans could be needed to actually land on the planet

# Unresolved Questions
- Since I dont want to keep world files around for planets that were barely interacted with, how do we figure out when to keep the world, and when to not?
