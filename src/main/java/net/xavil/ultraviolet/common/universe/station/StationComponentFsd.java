// FSD
// FSD injector
//
// - needs constant supply of fuel/energy when in use, either while jumping, or while moving about within a system/galaxy
// - can slowly change its field strength without consuming large amounts of fuel/energy
// - needs large pulse of fuel/energy when drastically changing its field strength, like when jumping.
// - the amount of motion you can get out of a set amount of fuel is smaller when in a more extreme gravity well.
// - failure to maintain a supply of energy while the FSD is engaged will cause an immediate dropout into normal space (perhaps with some tumbling involved :p)
